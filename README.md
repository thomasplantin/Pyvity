# Pyvity

This project is a computer simulation of projectile motion written in Python and using the PyGame library. It simulates the effect of the gravities found on different planets and on the moon.

## Instructions on how to operate the simulation

1 - Clone the repository to your local machine.
2 - Make sure you have the `PyGame` library installed. If it is not installed, run `pip install pygame` from the `Pyvity` directory.
3 - From the `Pyvity` directory, run `python pyvity.py` to start the simulation.
4 - Left click anywhere inside the new window to launch the projectile.
4 - Use the `Left` and `Right` arrow keys of your keyboard to switch gravities.
5 - Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> or close the window to end the simulation.
